app.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log("server running on port no 4000");
});
```

```javascript
const API_URL = "http://localhost:4000"; // local backend
```

### Database Setup (Optional)
For full functionality with MongoDB:
1. Install MongoDB on your system
2. Uncomment the MongoDB connection code in `backend/index.js`
3. Update the connection string if needed

# Test login
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
